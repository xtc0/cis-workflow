  2.3.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - updated object_diff role to use the infra namespace, that means to use the
        role it requires the infra version of the collection. Previous version required
        the redhat_cop
      bugfixes:
      - Fixed name of task for inventory source update
      - Fixed variable definitions in readmes
      - Removed master_role_example as no longer required (this wasn't a functional

      minor_changes:
      - Adapt filetree_read role tests playbook config-controller-filetree.yml.
      - 'Add new type of objects for object_diff role:  applications, execution environments,
        instance groups, notifications and schedules'
      - Add no_log to all tasks that populates data to avoid exposing encrypted data
      - Add task to add Galaxy credentials and Execution Environments to Organization.
      - Added argument_spec for all roles
      - Set the variables to assign_galaxy_credentials_to_org and assign_default_ee_to_org
        to false in the task to run all roles at dispatch role.
      - avoid to create orgs during drop_diff
      - fixed an extra blank line in schedules readme that was breaking the table

    fragments:
    - arg_spec.yml
    - dispatch_fix.yml
    release_date: '2023-03-24'
  2.4.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fixed defaults for values that are lists.
      - Fixed filetree read to error when organization not defined.
      - Fixed rrule in schedules to not be mandatory.
      minor_changes:
      - Added Roles bulk_host_create, bulk_job_launch.
      - Added new_name option to the roles applications, credential_types, execution_environments,
        inventories, projects, users.
      - Added new_username option to user role.
      - Added option to multiple roles to enforce defaults. This is described in each
        of the roles readmes and will slowly be rolled out to all applicable roles.
        This option enforces module/api defaults in order to prevent config drift.
        This makes it so if an option is NOT specified in a configuration it enforces
        the default value. It is not enabled by default.
      - Added scm_branch option to inventory_sources role.
      - Corrected various readmes.
      - Credentials role credential type set to mandatory. This would fail in the
        past if it was not set, this just codifies it.
      - If someone wants to have the old behavior, or only update projects with dispatch,
        the dispatch variable controller_configuration_dispatcher_roles can be overwritten
        and customized.
      - Instances role - changed default of node_type and node_state to omit, as generally
        these cannot be changed on existing instances unless deploying new instances.
      - Inventory role - added input_inventories option for constructed inventories.
      - Removed project_update from dispatch. This is because with bringing update_project
        option in line with the module options, it was running twice both in project
        and project update. Since both roles use the same variable controller_projects.
      - Set the default behavior of project_update to run the update as true, unless
        the user explicitly sets the variable update_project to overide the default
        behavior. This is because if the user is specifically calling project_update
        it should by default update the project.
      - Updated workflow job template options to use non depreciated names for options.
        This should not affect any operations.
      - added alias's for applicable roles to use the variables set by the awx cli
        export.
      - added get_stats.yml playbook in the playbook folder to get some basic info
        on a Tower/Controller instance
      - added option for using the export form of default execution environment.
      - added option to roles role to support upcoming change to allow lists of teams
        and users to be used in the module.
      - added options to license role to allow use of subcription lookup or pool_id.

  2.4.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Changes default value for `*_enforce_defaults` to false instead of the truthy
        value (due to the quotes), 'false'.
      - 'Fix addition of `state: present` when `with_present: true`'
      - Temporarily fixed an error when installing docker-compose using pip (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76708329/docker-compose-no-longer-building-image-attributeerror-cython-sources
        for more information)
      - When exporting job templates it was failing when missing some input information.
      - When exporting schedules, the diff_mode was not treated correctly
      - When importing the exported notification templates, the types of some values
        are not as expected.
      - 'When importing the exported settings, fields like `AUTOMATION_ANALYTICS_LAST_GATHER:
        2023-07-17T13:22:06.445818Z` caused problems with the multiple `:`.'
      - fix 'credentials' role ignoring 'update_secrets false' and forcing to default
        'true'
      - fixed an the users and teams field on the roles role to be correct and not
        singular.
      minor_changes:
      - Add option to change async directory, and set the default to null. /tmp/.ansible_async
        was a workaround while the default was broken previously.
      - Change from lookup to query in the object_diff task files
      - add organizations tag in a dispatch task which is in charge of applying galaxy
        credencitals in the organization.
      - added the instance_groups filed to the roles role.

  2.5.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fixed issue with licence role not operating properly, when a controller never
        had credentials provided for subscription lookup. See Role Readme for proper
        usuage.
      - Fixed issue with organization role not acceppting default environments option
        correctly.
      minor_changes:
      - Adds request_timeout to controller_export_diff module, and roles
      - licence role now uses a boolean of controller_license.use_looup to determine
        whether to lookup subscriptions. A lookup is only needed to refresh the available
        pools, or if it has never been done. See Role Readme for details.

  2.5.2:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fixed issue with organization creation with instance group. Execute instance
        and instance_group before organizations.
      - dispatch - Fixed the order and behavior to run as a single task with options
        for organization behavior.
      - filetree_create - Fixed the misspelled variable name that caused exported
        job_templates yaml files containing incorrect name.
      - filetree_create and object_diff- Subelement filter is executed before when
        and it was causing a failure when the list was not defined.

  2.6.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fixed an issue where the diff doesn't work correctly when explicitly setting
        state present
      - Fixed an issue where the usage access to instance_groups were removed
      - Fixed member removal of teams
      - The role 'credentials' have had the enforced defaults removed from team, user,
        and organization options. This was causing an error with these parameters
        were mutally exclusive.
      - The role 'inventory_sources' will now skip when the source parameter is `constructed`.
        These sources are auto created and not meant to be edited. However they can
        still be synced with the inventory_source_update.
      - The role 'workflow_job_templates' Default enforced value set for workflow
        templates limit was 0, was corrected to be an empty string.
      minor_changes:
      - The role 'filetree_create' will now allow to export all the objects of one
        kind into a single file, so it can be loaded by both ansible `group_vars`
        syntax and `filetree_read` tool.
      - added improvements to checkmod where it will run faster with the async tasks.
        In addition added an additional fail check at end of dispatch that will likely
        fail if dependencies are missing, as expected.
      - added mandatory check to workflow launch name option
      - filetree_create - Add the constructed inventory exportation fields from the
        API endpoint `api/v2/constructed_inventories`

      - Fixed roles diff when the roles are provided as a list, in a single entry
      - Organization not defined when exporting some inventory sources from Tower
        3.7.2
      minor_changes:
      - Add `assign_notification_templates_to_org` option to organization role to
        allow conditional assigning of notification templates
      - Updated dispatch role with `assign_notification_templates_to_org` option assigned
        to organization as False on first run and True on second run by default.
