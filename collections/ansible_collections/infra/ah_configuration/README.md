## Included content

Click the `Content` button to see the list of content included in this collection.

## Installing this collection

You can install the galaxy galaxy collection with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install infra.ah_configuration
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: infra.ah_configuration
    # If you need a specific version of the collection, you can specify like this:
    # version: ...
```

## Using this collection

Define following vars here, or in `galaxy_configs/galaxy_auth.yml`
`galaxy_server: ansible-galaxy-web-svc-test-project.example.com`

You can also specify authentication by setting the following variables:

- `galaxy_server`, `galaxy_oauthtoken`, `ah_token`

The OAuth2 token is the only method. You can obtain the token through the web interface. If you only pass a username and password to galaxy API roles/modules a new OAUTH2 token will be generated, invalidating the previous user token. To ensure this doesn't occur always set the ah_token variable to the users OAUTH2 token before executing automation. This does not affect pulp API calls.

Galaxy API calls

- group
- namespace
- publish
- repository
- repository_sync
- user

These can be specified via (from highest to lowest precedence):

- direct role variables as mentioned above
